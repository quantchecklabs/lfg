// Fleet completion bus for the voice assistant.
//
// Before this, the voice brain (deploy/voice/agent.py) learned about other
// sessions only at connect (a one-shot snapshot baked into its system prompt)
// or by polling get_fleet_status itself mid-turn. Nothing told it when another
// session FINISHED. This module turns "a session just completed a turn" into a
// PUSH:
//
//   - a single background watcher samples each session's busy state on an
//     interval and detects busy -> idle transitions (= a session landed work),
//   - it fans those out as events to any subscriber,
//   - serve exposes them over SSE at /api/voice/events; the voice worker
//     subscribes, refreshes its live context, and can speak a proactive
//     heads-up the instant a session lands.
//
// The watcher is process-global and idempotent (one loop regardless of how many
// subscribers connect). Busy detection reuses the exact signals the live view
// already streams: a tmux pane via isBusy(), a pane-less aisdk/codex/opencode
// session via the registry's isEntryBusy().
