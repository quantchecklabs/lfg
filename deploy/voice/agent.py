"""
lfg voice agent worker (LiveKit Agents 1.6.x) — high-performance realtime path.

Pipeline (every stage streams + overlaps the next):
  room audio
    -> Silero VAD + semantic end-of-utterance model (fast, accurate turn-taking)
    -> STT: streaming NeMo cache-aware FastConformer over a websocket when
       STT_WS_URL is set (interim + final transcripts); else batch lfg
       /api/voice/stt (faster-whisper) as the safe default.
    -> LLM: Haiku via the Messages API streamed over SSE — text deltas are
       spoken as they arrive (anthropic_stream + LfgLLM).
    -> TTS: lfg /api/voice/tts wrapped in a sentence StreamAdapter, so sentence 1
       synthesizes while the model is still generating sentence 2 (build_tts).
    -> agent audio track back to the room.

Realtime add-ons (VAD, turn-detector, streaming STT, TTS StreamAdapter) are each
optional: if a plugin/model/weight isn't installed the worker logs it and falls
back to the previous batch/default behavior, so it always starts.

Env:
  STT_WS_URL            ws:// endpoint of the streaming-STT server
                        (deploy/streaming-stt); unset = batch STT.
  LIVEKIT_INFERENCE_URL set only if you run a LiveKit inference gateway / Cloud;
                        unset = on-box local turn detection (the self-hosted norm).
Extra deps for the realtime path (install into the lk-agent venv):
  livekit-plugins-turn-detector   (local end-of-utterance model)
  then once: `python agent.py download-files` to fetch its weights.
VAD is AgentSession's bundled Silero default — no separate plugin needed.

    "state with get_fleet_status / list_sessions before acting, stay within the "

    "lists, no symbols meant to be read aloud. Be direct and conversational.\n"
    "WHO YOU SERVE: you are scoped to ONE person — the user speaking to you. The "
    "snapshot and list_sessions show only THEIR sessions, and you act only on "
    "their fleet. 'My project', 'it', 'this', or 'that session' (with no name) "
    "means their currently focused session — resolve it from the FOCUS line in "
    "your context before acting.\n"
    "CRITICAL for speed and not being annoying:\n"
    "- Answer in ONE short sentence. NEVER narrate or preface — no 'let me "
    "check', 'one moment', 'I'm checking'. Just answer.\n"
    "- NEVER claim an action happened until you have seen its tool result. Say "
    "what you are ABOUT to do (present tense), never that it is already done, "
    "until the result comes back — then confirm it, or say it failed.\n"
    "- Do NOT call a tool unless the user CLEARLY asks about session/fleet "
    "status, asks to act on a specific session, or asks a technical/informative "
    "question that warrants a session (see ANSWERING QUESTIONS below). For "
    "greetings/small talk, just reply — no tools.\n"
    "- If what you heard is short, empty, unclear, or garbled, do NOT guess and "
    "do NOT act — briefly ask the user to repeat.\n"
    "- For a SIMPLE ambiguity (which of two sessions did they mean?), just ASK "
    "the user in one short sentence. Do NOT consult the advisor for that.\n"
    "ANSWERING QUESTIONS: for casual, conversational, or quick factual questions, "
    "just answer in one short sentence. But for any TECHNICAL or INFORMATIVE "
    "question — how something works, what the code/repo/architecture does, why a "
    "bug happens, how to build or fix something, research, or anything needing "
    "real depth or accuracy — do NOT answer it yourself from memory. You are a "
    "fast lightweight voice brain and would likely be shallow or wrong. Instead "
    "create_session to spin up a coding agent that investigates with full repo and "
    "tool access and answers it properly. Say one short sentence that you're "
    "opening a session to look into it, then call create_session with a clear "
    "one-line prompt capturing the question. Only skip the session if the user "
    "explicitly says they just want your quick take.\n\n"
    "You can act on the fleet with tools. ALWAYS resolve a session to its exact "
    "id (from list_sessions or the snapshot) BEFORE reply_to_session, "
    "answer_session_prompt, or close_session — never act on a guessed id.\n"
    "- get_fleet_status — re-read live status of the user's sessions. The "
    "snapshot in your context goes stale fast: ALWAYS call this first whenever "
    "the user asks what's happening now, the current status, whether a session "
    "finished/changed, or anything time-sensitive. Answer from the fresh "
    "result, not the connect-time snapshot.\n"
    "- list_sessions — get session ids + titles, plus agent kind, model, "
    "project, status, and how long each has been idle (needed before acting on "
    "one, and to answer which-session-is-which questions).\n"
    "- search_transcript — search ONE session's full history for a word/phrase "
    "and get matching snippets. Use it when the user asks what a session said, "
    "decided, or worked on — the snapshot only shows its latest line.\n"
    "- list_repos — list the projects/repos a new session can start in (name + "
    "path); use it to resolve the folder when the user names a project.\n"
    "- create_session — start a NEW coding-agent session, either to DO a task or "
    "to GO FIND OUT something the user wants to know (spin up an agent to "
    "investigate, e.g. 'check our analytics' or 'see how the auth fix is "
    "going'). Pass a clear one-line `prompt`. It defaults to the user's focused "
    "project; pass `cwd` (from list_repos) only when they name a different one. "
    "Optionally pass `agent` (`codex-aisdk` for Codex, `opencode` for OpenCode) "
    "and, for any Claude or Codex session, `thinkingLevel` as low, medium, high, "
    "or xhigh to set how hard it reasons. "
    "You CAN create sessions from voice — do it when the user asks, don't tell "
    "them to use the dashboard.\n"
    "- reply_to_session — send an instruction to another session.\n"
    "- answer_session_prompt — pick an option for a session that is BLOCKED on "
    "a permission/plan prompt (use the option index from its snapshot line).\n"
    "- close_session — shut down / end a session the user is done with. Resolve "
    "the exact id first; never close your own voice session.\n"
    "- consult_advisor — hand a genuinely HARD or RISKY question to a stronger "
    "deep-thinking model that has full repo + tool access and can act on the "
    "fleet itself. Use it ONLY when careful reasoning is truly needed, NOT for "
    "simple disambiguation. It takes a while, so first say one short spoken "
    "sentence telling the user you're checking with the advisor.\n"
    "Prefer answer_session_prompt over reply_to_session when a session is "

# ── transcript gate: kill noise-/crowd-triggered turns ───────────────────────
# The user's main symptom is ambient + crowd babble FALSELY triggering a turn:
# VAD fires on diffuse noise, the clip reaches STT, and the model "transcribes"
# it into a phantom phrase the brain then answers out loud. DTLN + the browser
# noise-canceller cut most of this at the audio layer, and the VAD is tuned so
# crowd babble shouldn't cross it — but anything that slips through still lands as
# an ASR hallucination. Those hallucinations are overwhelmingly a tiny, known set
# of fillers ("you", "thank you", "thanks for watching", "[BLANK_AUDIO]", a bare
# "."). So we gate the COMMITTED transcript: a turn whose text is empty, has no
# real word characters (punctuation/symbols only), or is exactly one known filler
# is dropped — it never becomes a user message and never reaches run_brain.
#
# Deliberately CONSERVATIVE: we gate on "no lexical content" / known-filler-only,
# never on length. Real short commands ("yes", "no", "stop", "go", "wait") have
# word characters and aren't in the filler set, so they always pass.

    The user's main symptom is ambient + crowd babble (diffuse, many overlapping
    voices — NOT one distinct background speaker) FALSELY triggering a turn. The
    first line of defence is to keep that babble from crossing the VAD at all, so
    it never even reaches STT.

    DTLN (see _build_noise_cancellation) plus the browser noise-canceller strip
    most steady noise before the VAD, which both cleans real speech AND pushes
    diffuse babble down to a low, smeared speech-probability. That headroom lets
    us hold the activation bar HIGH without hurting genuine close-mic speech
    (which stays high-probability after denoising):
      - activation_threshold = 0.6      : a frame needs a clearly speech-like
        probability to START a turn. Diffuse crowd babble — even when the denoiser
        leaves a little — sits below this, so it doesn't open a turn; a real user
        talking into the mic crosses it easily.
      - deactivation_threshold = 0.35   : keep the wide hysteresis band (0.6 to
        start, 0.35 to stop) so once a real turn is open, brief dips don't chatter
        it on/off — and babble riding near the bar can't toggle speech.
      - min_speech_duration = 0.08      : a short floor so a transient babble peak
        or click can't open a turn, while still catching quick real onsets.
    Whatever still slips through the VAD is caught downstream by the transcript
    gate (_is_meaningful), which drops ASR hallucinations like "thanks for
    watching" before they reach the brain. VAD here = don't even listen to babble;
    gate = don't act on babble that got transcribed anyway.
    NB: we use the (deprecated-in-2.0 but proven-LOCAL) silero loader on purpose —
    it loads the on-box ONNX model directly. The inference.* path routes through a
    LiveKit inference executor this self-hosted box doesn't have (the same reason
    the local EOU turn-detector is disabled above). Returns None on any failure so
    the caller omits vad= and AgentSession falls back to its bundled default —
    never vad=None, which would disable VAD entirely."""
