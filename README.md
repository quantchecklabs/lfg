# lfg

Run AI coding agents on your own machine, from anywhere.

`lfg` turns a Linux box or macOS workstation into a private control plane for
Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok, and Hermes. It starts each agent in a long-lived `tmux`
session, streams the transcript to a web UI, and lets you answer prompts or steer
work from your phone or laptop.

**Website:** [lfg.apps.omg.dev](https://lfg.apps.omg.dev)

## Why lfg?

- **Run agents where your code lives.** Sessions execute on your machine, in your
  repos, with your local CLIs and credentials.
- **Use a real web UI.** Launch sessions, watch output, answer permission
  prompts, switch projects, and resume work from an installable PWA.
- **Keep it private.** The server binds to loopback by default and is designed to
  be exposed through Tailscale, not the public internet.
- **Automate repo checks.** Optional markdown-defined agents can collect git,
  repo, GitHub, model, or security context and produce reports.

The images are stored in this repo instead of hotlinked, so the README renders
reliably on GitHub.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- `tmux`
- `git`
- At least one supported agent CLI on `PATH`:
  - `claude`
  - `codex`
  - `opencode`
  - `hermes`
- Optional: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for private remote access

## Quick Start

Install on an Ubuntu/Debian VPS or macOS workstation:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BennyKok/lfg/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
```

For a non-interactive Tailscale setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BennyKok/lfg/main/scripts/setup.sh \
  | TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-xxxx bash
```

The setup script downloads the latest release, installs production dependencies,
writes `.env`, and starts the server as a user service bound to loopback.

To expose the UI over your private tailnet, opt in to Tailscale Serve:

```bash
LFG_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1 lfg setup
```

## One-click Launch

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template?template=https://github.com/BennyKok/lfg)

Railway is useful for a hosted demo, but `lfg` works best on the machine that
has your repos, `tmux`, and authenticated agent CLIs. See
[deploy/railway](./deploy/railway/README.md) for details.

The shared [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) also works as the base for
[Fly.io](./deploy/fly/README.md), [Render](./deploy/render/README.md),
[DigitalOcean](./deploy/digitalocean/README.md), and
[Koyeb](./deploy/koyeb/README.md). These PaaS targets are best for demos or
private-network deployments; a VPS remains the cleanest production-style target.
Because the Vibes SDK path is not live for source installs yet, the Dockerfile
installs the published bundled release (`lfg-bundle.tar.gz`) instead of building
from the GitHub source tree. Publish a bundle with `scripts/release.sh <tag>`
before relying on one-click cloud deploys.

For Hetzner, use the cloud-init template in
[deploy/hetzner](./deploy/hetzner/README.md). Hetzner's official deploy button
only preselects Hetzner App images, so the repo ships a first-boot installer
instead.

Railway user requirements:

- Railway account and GitHub access to this repo.
- Keep Public Networking disabled unless you put auth in front of `lfg`.
- For Tailscale access, add Railway's Tailscale router as a second service and
  put `TS_AUTHKEY` on that router service.
- Optional provider keys in Railway variables, such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.

Hetzner user requirements:

- Hetzner Cloud account, SSH public key, and either the `hcloud` CLI or Console.
- Tailscale account plus an ephemeral/preauthorized auth key for unattended
  setup. The installer joins the server with `tailscale up --authkey ...` and
  exposes the loopback-only UI through `tailscale serve`.
- After boot, authenticate `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, or `hermes` on the server, or
  configure API-key based providers in `.env`.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennyKok/lfg.git
cd lfg
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bun run serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8766`.

Authenticate the agent CLI you want to use, for example by running `claude` once
and completing OAuth, or by setting the required API key in `.env`.

## Commands

```bash
bun run serve                  # web UI + control server
bun run agents -- list         # list markdown-defined agents
bun run agents -- run <name>   # run an insight agent
bun run whatsapp -- run        # optional WhatsApp sidecar
bun run setup                  # rerun provisioning/update flow
```

Installed release builds expose the same commands through `lfg`.

## Configuration

Configuration lives in `.env`; see [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

Common settings:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LFG_HOST` | Bind address. Keep `127.0.0.1` unless you know the risk. |
| `LFG_PORT` | Web UI and API port. Defaults to `8766`. |
| `LFG_REPOS_ROOT` | Directory scanned for git repos. |
| `LFG_CLAUDE_PATH` | Override the `claude` binary path. |
| `LFG_CODEX_PATH` | Override the `codex` binary path. |
| `LFG_OPENCODE_PATH` | Override the `opencode` binary path. |
| `LFG_HERMES_PATH` | Override the `hermes` binary path. |
| `LFG_HERMES_PROVIDER` | Optional provider override passed to `hermes chat --provider`; empty uses Hermes' configured/default provider. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional API key for Claude SDK-backed flows. |
| `LFG_WHATSAPP_*` | Optional WhatsApp bridge settings. |
| `LFG_INSTALL_CHANNEL` | Optional install-channel override: `source`, `release`, or `container`. Normally written by setup/container deploys. |

## Security

`lfg` launches AI agents with shell access on your machine. The control API is
unauthenticated by design because it is meant to run on loopback and be accessed
privately through Tailscale.

Do not expose `lfg` directly to the public internet. Read
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) before sharing access.
